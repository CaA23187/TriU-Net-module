## About TriU-Net
TriU-Net is a hybrid neural beamformer for multi-channel speech enhancement. In this repo, we share the weights of TriU-Net trained on a 9-channel, 4-cm interval uniform linear array.
For more details, please refer to https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/153/6/3378/2897718/Three-stage-hybrid-neural-beamformer-for-multi

## How to Use
1. install python 3.10
2. install Torch == 1.12.1+cu116 (Other versions should also work but have not been tested), soundfile, numpy, tqdm
3. run "python demo.py"
4. the enhanced wav is 'wavs/enhanced.wav'
